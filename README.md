# Booker 
Booker is a service aimed at providing the users with their next books to read, Booker gives the users the details and information regarding each book
that is available in the Project Gutenberg website, while also reducing and minimalizing the information that is given the website itself.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs
Booker takes advantage of gutindex API service, and a custom-built minimal template for HTML and CSS, for removing the
unnesseccary details and extra data that the users don't need

## Lessons Learned:
During this project I experienced how tedious hard-coding API responses to a website is,
and how useful tools like EJS are for improving user response and general speed perfomance of the website.
## Parts to work on:
-Implement EJS instead of hard-codding
